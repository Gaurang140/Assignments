    "**Q1. What is the role of the 'else' block in a try-except statement? Provide an example scenario where it would be useful.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** The `else` block in a `try-except` statement is executed when no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. It's useful for executing code that should run only when the `try` block completes without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Can a try-except block be nested inside another try-except block? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Yes, a `try-except` block can be nested inside another `try-except` block. Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # inner try block\n",
    "    except Exception as e_inner:\n",
    "        # handle inner exception\n",
    "except Exception as e_outer:\n",
    "    # handle outer exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How can you create a custom exception class in Python? Provide an example that demonstrates its usage.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** You can create a custom exception class by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class. Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "except CustomError as ce:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught custom exception:\", ce)\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are some common exceptions that are built-in to Python?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Some common built-in exceptions are `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, `NameError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Logging is the process of recording events, messages, and errors during program execution. It's important for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications, as it provides insights into the program's behavior without cluttering the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when each log level would be appropriate.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Log levels indicate the severity of a log message. Examples:\n",
    "  - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging.\n",
    "  - `INFO`: General information about the program's progress.\n",
    "  - `WARNING`: Indications of potential issues that don't halt the program.\n",
    "  - `ERROR`: Critical errors that may lead to program failure.\n",
    "  - `CRITICAL`: Very severe errors that may crash the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log message format using formatters?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Log formatters determine how log messages are formatted when outputted. You can customize formats using placeholders like `%(levelname)s`, `%(asctime)s`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Use the `logging.getLogger(__name__)` method to get a logger instance for the module or class. This ensures that log messages are grouped by source.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Logging provides a structured way to record and manage output, with log levels and formatted messages. Use logging for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications, especially in production environments. `print` is simpler and more suitable for quick debugging or testing.\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Q10. Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the following requirements:**\n",
    "- **Ans:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename=\"app.log\", level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "logging.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q11. Create a Python program that logs an error message to the console and a file named \"errors.log\" if an exception occurs during the program's execution. The error message should include the exception type and a timestamp.**\n",
    "- **Ans:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename=\"errors.log\", level=logging.ERROR)\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    logging.error(f\"Exception {type(e).__name__} occurred at {datetime.datetime.now()}: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",

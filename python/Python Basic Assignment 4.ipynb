    "   - **Ans:** The two methods for removing items from a list are `pop()` and `remove()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `pop()` method removes and returns the element at a specified index. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last element by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `remove()` method removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list. It does not require an index but needs the value to be removed.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "                              my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",

    "12. **Describe how list values and string values are identical.**\n",
    "    - **Ans:**  Both list values and string values are sequences of individual elements in Python. Elements in a list can be of any data type, and they are enclosed in square brackets [...], while elements in a string are characters and are enclosed in single quotes '...' or double quotes \"...\". Lists and strings are both ordered collections, which means the order of elements matters. Additionally, both lists and strings support indexing and slicing operations to access specific elements or subsequences.\n",

    "    - **Ans:** You can convert a list to a tuple using the tuple() constructor, and you can convert a tuple to a list using the list() constructor.\n",

    "16. **Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?**\n",
    "    - **Ans:**    Variables containing list values store references to the lists, not the contents. Assigning a list to a variable creates a reference to the list's memory location, allowing multiple variables to reference the same list. Changes via one variable affect others referring to the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **How do you distinguish between `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()`?**\n",
    "    - **Ans:**  In Python's copy module, copy.copy() makes a shallow copy of an object, including lists, creating a new object that shares nested elements. In contrast, copy.deepcopy() creates an independent deep copy, recursively duplicating all elements, preventing unintended modifications to the original object's nested elements.\n",

    "1. **Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Functions are advantageous because of the reusability we can use function to perform perticular task whenever we need it we dont need to write that code again and again  , another advantageous is  readability , modularity and debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "2. **When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?**\n",
    "- Ans : Function run when its called\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "3. **What statement creates a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans :  We use ```def``` keyword to define or create function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "4. **What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n",
    "- Ans : Function is the block where we define function using ```def``` keyword whereas , function call is  where we call the function run specific task\n",
    "for example :\n",
    "```python\n",
    "                # here i have define the function \n",
    "                def function():\n",
    "                    mystring = \"hi! , this is my first function\" \n",
    "                    return mystring \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                # here i am calling my function to perform specific task\n",
    "                call_my_func = function()\n",
    "                print(call_my_func)\n",

    "5. **How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**\n",
    "- Ans :  There is only one global scope  in python which is throughout the program module or file whereas, within each fuction call creates local scope. these local scopes are independent of each other and the global scope\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**\n",
    "- Ans : When the function call returns, the local variable within that function's scope are destroyed. variables are no longer accesable after executing the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "7. **What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?**\n",
    "- Ans : In simple term return value is the result of function. yes, it is possible to return value in expression.\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "                    def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "                        result = a + b\n",
    "                        return result  # This is the return value\n",
    "\n",
    "                    # Calling the function and using its return value in an expression\n",
    "                    sum_result = add_numbers(5, 7)\n",
    "                    product_result = add_numbers(3, 4) * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "                    print(\"Sum result:\", sum_result)\n",
    "                    print(\"Product result:\", product_result)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "8. **If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n",
    "- Ans : If function does not have return statement than it returns to the ```None``` or else we can use  ````print()```` function to get final result.\n",
    "This indicate that this variable is global and any changes will affect the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : to make a function variable refer to global varialbe we need to assingn that variable to global using ````global```` keywords inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "10. **What is the data type of None?**\n",
    "- Ans : The data type of ``None`` is NoneType. it represents the absence of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "11. **What does the sentence `import areallyourpetsnamederic` do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans :  First it  will try to import this module if its exist it will import this module or else it will raise ``ImportError`` or  ``ModuleNotFoundError``\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import areallyourpetsnamederic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **If you had a `bacon()` feature in a `spam` module, what would you call it after importing `spam`?**\n",
    "- Ans : from spam import bacon  or import spam. below you can see the  example\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from spam import bacon \n",
    "bacon()\n",
    "# or \n",
    "import spam\n",
    "\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What can you do to save a program from crashing if it encounters an error?**\n",
    "- Ans : You can use exception handling to catch and handle errors. By using try and except blocks, you can easily handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "14. **What is the purpose of the `try` clause? What is the purpose of the `except` clause?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Ans: The try clause is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception. The purpose of the try clause is to catch exceptions and allow the program to continue running even if an error occurs. The except clause is used to specify the code that should be executed if a specific exception occurs within the try block.\n"

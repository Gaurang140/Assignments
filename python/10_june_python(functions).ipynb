    "**Q1. In Python, what is the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function? Provide an example of each.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** A built-in function is provided by Python itself and can be used without creating it. Example: `len()` to get the length of a list. A user-defined function is created by the programmer. Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "length = len([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Q2. How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Arguments are values passed to a function. Positional arguments are passed based on the position. Keyword arguments are passed with their names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of positional argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, message):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! {message}\")\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\", \"How are you?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of keyword argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greet(message=\"How are you?\", name=\"Alice\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return statements? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** The `return` statement sends a value back from a function. Yes, a function can have multiple `return` statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def absolute_value(x):\n",
    "    if x < 0:\n",
    "        return -x\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "result = absolute_value(-5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Q4. What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an example where a lambda function can be useful.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword. They are used for short operations. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "double = lambda x: x * 2\n",
    "result = double(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def double(x):\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "result = double(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How does the concept of \"scope\" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local scope and global scope.**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Scope defines where a variable can be accessed. Local scope is within a function and can't be accessed outside. Global scope is outside any function and can be accessed everywhere.\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How can you use the \"return\" statement in a Python function to return multiple values?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** You can return multiple values as a tuple using the `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_details():\n",
    "    name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "    age = 30\n",
    "    return name, age\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. What is the difference between the \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" concepts when it comes to function arguments in Python?**\n",
    "- **Ans:** Python passes arguments by value, but for mutable objects like lists, it feels like pass by reference because changes inside the function affect the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. Create a function that can intake an integer or decimal value and perform logarithmic, exponential, power functions with base 2, and square root operations.**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def math_operations(x):\n",
    "    log_result = math.log(x)\n",
    "    exp_result = math.exp(x)\n",
    "    power_result = 2 ** x\n",
    "    sqrt_result = math.sqrt(x)\n",
    "    return log_result, exp_result, power_result, sqrt_result\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. Create a function that takes a full name as an argument and returns first name and last name.**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def split_name(full_name):\n",
    "    first_name, last_name = full_name.split()\n",
    "    return first_name, last_name\n",

    "**Q1. Create two `int` type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the variables:**\n",

    "First variable is __ & second variable is __.\n",
    "Addition: __ + __ = __\n",
    "Subtraction: __ - __ = __\n",

    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create two integer variables\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform arithmetic operations and store results\n",

    "(i) ‘/’ & ‘//’\n",
    "(ii) ‘**’ & ‘^’\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) The `'/'` operator is used for division in Python and returns a floating-point result. The `'//'` operator, known as floor division, also performs division but truncates the decimal part, giving an integer result.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) The `'**'` operator is used for exponentiation in Python, where `x ** y` means x raised to the power of y. The `'^'` operator, however, is not an exponentiation operator in Python. Instead, it's the bitwise XOR operator, used for performing bitwise exclusive OR on the binary representations of numbers.\n",

    "**Q3. List the logical operators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The logical operators in Python are:\n",
    "- `and`: Returns `True` if both operands are true.\n",
    "- `or`: Returns `True` if at least one operand is true.\n",
    "- `not`: Returns the opposite of the operand's truth value.\n",

    "**Q4. Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The right shift operator (`>>`) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. The left shift operator (`<<`) shifts the bits to the left. Here are examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Right shift\n",
    "num = 8  # Binary: 1000\n",
    "result = num >> 1  # Binary after right shift by 1: 0100 (Decimal 4)\n",

    "# Left shift\n",
    "num = 4  # Binary: 0100\n",
    "result = num << 2  # Binary after left shift by 2: 1000 (Decimal 8)\n",

    "**Q5. Create a list containing `int` type data of length 15. Then write code to check if 10 is present in the list or not.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a list of integers\n",
    "num_list = [2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]\n",

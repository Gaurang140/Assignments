    "### 1. Primary Goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "- **Ans:** The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize and structure code by representing real-world entities as objects, promoting code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Object in Python\n",
    "- **Ans:** An object in Python is an instance of a class. It encapsulates both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to a particular entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Class in Python\n",
    "- **Ans:** A class in Python is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating instances (objects) with shared attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Attributes and Methods in a Class\n",
    "- **Ans:** Attributes are variables that store data within a class, representing characteristics of objects. Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that objects of that class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Class Variables vs. Instance Variables in Python\n",
    "- **Ans:** Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are defined outside methods. Instance variables are specific to each object instance and are defined within methods using the `self` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Purpose of the `self` Parameter in Python Class Methods\n",
    "- **Ans:** The `self` parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class itself. It allows access to instance-specific attributes and methods within the method and helps distinguish between instance variables and local variables.\n"
